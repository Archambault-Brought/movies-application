        <h1>Movies and their ratings</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our Movie page. You may add movies and a rating.  You may also edit an existing movie as well as delete a movie from this list.  </p>

<!--        maybe we can add a function that takes in a rating for each movie and averages it out?-->
<!--Allow users to add new movies

Create a form for adding a new movie that has fields for the movie's title and rating
When the form is submitted, the page should not reload / refresh, instead, your javascript should make a POST request to /api/movies with the information the user put into the form
Allow users to edit existing movies

Give users the option to edit an existing movie
A form should be pre-populated with the selected movie's details
Like creating a movie, this should not involve any page reloads, instead your javascript code should make an ajax request when the form is submitted.
Delete movies

Each movie should have a "delete" button
When this button is clicked, your javascript should send a DELETE request
-->
